Vector Databases: A Comprehensive Guide

Introduction
Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store and query high-dimensional vectors efficiently. They are essential for modern AI applications.

HNSW Indexing
Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) is a popular indexing method for vector databases. It creates a multi-layer graph structure that enables fast approximate nearest neighbor search. HNSW offers excellent recall-latency trade-offs.

LSH Indexing
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is another indexing technique. It uses hash functions to map similar vectors to the same buckets. However, LSH generally provides lower recall compared to HNSW.

Concurrent Write Operations
Modern vector databases handle concurrent writes through various locking mechanisms. Write operations are typically batched to improve throughput while maintaining consistency.

Performance Benchmarks
HNSW indexing achieves query latencies under 10ms for million-scale datasets. Write throughput can reach 10,000 vectors per second with proper configuration.

Conclusion
Vector databases are crucial infrastructure for AI applications, with HNSW being the most widely adopted indexing method.
